LOL Cards is your one stop ecommerce website where users can purchase League of Legends trading cards. 

LOL Cards was created by web developers Levar Bobb-Semple, Bill Munkacsy, Primo Gill, and Brandon Lowe. This is our first full e-commerse website and our first website deployment and we are excited to share our project with you!

LOL Cards was built using React.js, Node.js Redux.js, Express, JSON webtoken, Stripe checkout, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Axios

The website features a stylish user experience where users can login, view cards (products), add cards to a persistant guest or user cart, checkout using Stripe, view their previous orders, and update their password and profile.

LOL Cards also features an administrator backend where an administrator can edit, delete, update, and create a new card (product), view all users, delete a user, and view all previous orders.
